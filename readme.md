## Setup

Install some global dependencies:
```shell
npm install -g stylus
npm install -g autoprefixer-stylus
npm install -g coffee-script
npm install -g npm-check-updates
```

Edit `config.json`,

Then run `cake setup` to setup your environment.

## Set your environment [??]

`export NODE_ENV=development` (or production)

## 🍰 Party

Cool things happen through `cake`

`cake start` for the server, `cake styles` and `cake coffee` for compiling public stuff.

Then,

`localhost:3000`
